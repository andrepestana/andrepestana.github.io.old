Hi, my name is Andre Pestana and I'm a family guy software developer that loves music and graphic arts, psychology, language learning and technology.

I'm open to make new friends, learn things and see things in a different perspective. I can help you if you want to learn Portuguese, English. I'd love to continue learning French or Spanish.

Take a look at my Software Development [projects](/projects/). If you get insterested by any of them I'll be glad in explaining that to you or help you with anything if I can.
